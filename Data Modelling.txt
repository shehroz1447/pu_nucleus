DATA MODELLING/DATA WAREHOUSING/DIMENTSIONAL MODELLING

DATA WAREHOUSING: Using DWH tools to model data in a manner that enables analytics and BI

OLAP CUBES: Data arrangement in DWH, where the data is divided into fact and dimension tables

DIMENSION TABLES: This table contains textual information (a certain window) for viewing the fact table

FACT TABLES: This table contains measures and foreign keys of dimensions

GRAIN: The lowest data level or the atomic level

ADDITIVE FACT: A certain measure that can be fully summed across all dimensions

SEMI-ADDITIVE FACT: A certain measure that can be partially summed across all dimensions

NON-ADDITIVE FACT: A certain measure that can't be summed across any dimensions

FACTLESS FACT TABLE: A fact table without any measures

CONFORMED DIMENSION TABLES: A dimension table that can be resued by other fact tables

CONFORMED FACT TABLES: A fact table that can be by other fact tables

AGGREGATE TABLES: A table that contains predefined aggregations, used to boost performance

SUMMARY INFORMATION: Stores predefined aggreagations

ETL: Transfroming data to move it from data lake to data warehouse

DATAMARTS: Smaller version of DWH which deals with with a single subject and limited sources

METADATA: Information about the stored data in the DWH

DATAMINING: Process of analyzing data from the DWH in different dimensions and summarizing it into useful information

OLAP CUBE PROCESS - ROLL UP: Performing aggregation on data cube

OLAP CUBE PROCESS - DRILL DOWN: Reverse operation of Roll up

OLAP CUBE PROCESS - SLICE: Making a new sub cube from one dimension

OLAP CUBE PROCESS - DICE: Making a new sub cube from two or more dimensions

OLAP CUBE PROCESS - PIVOT: Transpostioning axes for a new alternative presentation of data

NORMALIZATION: Normalization in databases splits data into multiple tables. Reduces data redundancy. Faster Writes.

NORMALIZATION - 1NF: Each table cell should contain a single value and each record needs to be unique

NORMALIZATION - 2NF: (1NF) and Single Column Primary Key that does not functionally dependant on any subset of candidate key relation

NORMALIZATION - 3NF: (2NF) and has no transitive functional dependencies

ER DIAGRAM: Illustration of entities in databases. NO ER diagram in DWH only in DB
